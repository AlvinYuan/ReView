My final project for Fall 2014 Visualization

http://vis.berkeley.edu/courses/cs294-10-fa14/wiki/index.php/FP-AlvinYuan

This is a chrome extension that allows users to quickly clip any line chart on the web, extract the data from the chart, and then generate different visualizations of the same data to aid in interpretation.

Note that thirdparty/combined-compiled.js comes from building https://github.com/AlvinYuan/WebPlotDigitizer

To run: download/clone this into your filesystem, and follow the instructions here: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked

Once that's done, there should show a new icon next to the omnibox. Clicking on that starts the screenshot clipping.
